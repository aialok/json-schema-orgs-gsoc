# :wave: Hey there

We're very happy that you are considering contributing to our projects during Google Summer of Code. Please **introduce yourself** on the available [project ideas](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Agsoc+sort%3Acreated-desc).

You can introduce yourself to the project anytime before the contributor application period begins by answering the following questions on the selected [idea's thread](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Agsoc+sort%3Acreated-des).

Make sure to answer these questions:

- [ ] What interests you most about this project?
- [ ] As mentors and project coordinators, how can we get the best out of you?
- [ ] Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us?
- [ ] We'd love to hear a bit about your work preferences, e.g. how you keep yourself organized, what tools you use, etc?
- [ ] Once you’ve selected a project from the ideas section, please suggest a weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it. Alternatively, if you want to propose your own idea then please include an outline, goals, and a well-defined weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables.
