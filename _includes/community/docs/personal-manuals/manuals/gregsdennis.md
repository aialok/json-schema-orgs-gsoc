## Working Patterns

If I'm not asleep, I'm usually online.  I'm "desk working" 8-3ish M-F, New Zealand time, which is generally UTC+12/13 depending on the time of year.

While also my job, this is a passion project for me, so I'm quick to respond to most things either in GitHub or Slack, especially if I'm tagged directly.  Contact me ad-hoc.  During my "desk" hours, I'm open for meetings and chats.  Outside of those, I'll probably still respond, but don't be surprised if you have to wait until the next day.

My time is also split across several projects (of which this is the primary), so I'm not here 100%.  If you're interested what else I have going, feel free to ask.

I seek thorough understanding of anything I work on, and I like to get other people's viewpoints.

## Requirements

Please note the time difference.  I'm typically a few hours behind (and a day ahead) of US/Canada, and AM/PM-inverted for most places in Europe.

I try to at least take note of everything, even if I don't thoroughly read it.

I have notifications from GitHub and Slack piped through my phone, which is almost always within arm's reach.  Tag me in either if you really need me to see something.  Otherwise, I'll probably stumble across it in a short time frame.

I've become used to context switching.  I'm not immune by any means, but I understand that it's just part of the job.

## Feedback

DM me in Slack.  I have thick skin, but I am fairly opinionated.  These adages generally apply:

- "Strong opinions, weakly held" - [Paul Saffo](https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/)
- "Praise in public, criticism in private" - [Radical Candor, Kim Scott](https://www.radicalcandor.com/public-praise-private-criticism/#:~:text=A%20good%20rule%20of%20thumb,and%20to%20learn%20from%20it.)

## Stress

Again, it takes quite a bit to get me stressed, however I tend to reflect the energy coming at me.

In my experience, if there's a disagreement on anything, it usually means someone doesn't have some piece of the puzzle.  Ensuring everyone is working from the same context dataset is critically important.

## Non-work

My wife and I have two children, both in high school (as of this writing).

We moved from Texas to New Zealand mid-2016, and we love it here.

I'm an avid (ice) hockey fan.  Sadly there's not much demand for it here, so I have to get a subscription to stream games.

I enjoy video games (generally single-player, first-person), mechanical puzzles, and sitting outside just enjoying the planet.

I occasionally also dabble in woodworking and photography.

## Anything else?

The Dallas Stars are the best NHL team, even when they're losing.
