# @benjagm / Benjamin Granados' Personal User Manual

## Working Patterns

My normal working hours are around 09:30 to 18:30 CET, but you will easily find me engaging in Community discussions outside these hours or attending meetings in crazy timezones. I am a family man, and it requires a work-life balance, but I am extremely flexible on this.

I generally check email and Slack multiple times a day, and I have a zero-inbox personal policy. I have numerous small tasks combined with big planning items, which makes my schedule hybrid but with a clear mindset of getting things done + middle and long-term planning.

## Requirements

I work best when items of work are scheduled. I'm not likely to want ad-hoc immediate calls/meetings.
I am careful about sending meeting invites in the proper timezones, during the right working hours, and only in empty slots, and I appreciate when people do the same with me.

If you mention me in a conversation, please tag me.

## Feedback

I love candid and positive feedback because it is the best way to learn and improve, and I am constantly learning.

## Stress

Difficult to get stressed. When pressure and demand, I react positively, keeping a cool head, focusing on finding the root causes of the situation, proposing creative and efficient ways to solve the problem, and helping my peers to navigate the situation.

## Non-work

I am a father of two who loves to spend time with my family and friends. I love mountaineering and team sports, and I think nothing is impossible if you truly believe it. I love this sentence by Nelson Mandela "It always seems impossible until it's done".

## Anything else?

I enjoy good TV Shows like Succession, The Sopranos, The Wire or True Detective.
