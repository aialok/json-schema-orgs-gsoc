## Working Patterns

My normal working hours are around 10:00 to 18:00 ET, though I travel often and am often therefore on shifted time zones.
This can make my precise hours a bit erratic, but I'm generally happy to coordinate on times if there's a need for synchronous communication (e.g. a call).
I do try and balance my personal life, so at times I may decline to do so for some specific day or evening, but it's always worth asking as I'm not embarassed to say "no" in those cases, and I will say "yes" if I can indeed make it.

I generally check email and Slack multiple times a day, and for emails which reach my personal inbox may even be immediately notified, though I will often "table" an email or message if it requires more thinking to address.
I definitely have "turn off" days, or hours where I am focused on something specific, and may be much less responsive on those days.

I may send you slack messages at any time, but with no expectation of replying immediately.
Feel free to send me slack messages whenever, but do not expect an immediate reply.
I do not mind reminders, and though I believe I rarely "completely forget" an action item, I still benefit from knowing you're waiting on something specific and can think about how to prioritize it if reminded.

## Requirements

I work "constructively haphazardly" -- by which I mean I generally have many "large" things I'm trying to make progress on, but work on them in short bursts, and try to work on pieces that make me feel productive by moving them forward.
Sometimes this even involves circuitous routes which can look like procrastinating, but I value feeling productive greatly, and sometimes to get something hard done, I need to get some easy ones done to build momentum.
When I get stuck, I often move to something else I can be successful on, and then hope that in time switching back to what I started with will be easier (and it often is! The brain is a wonderful thing).
I'm very happy to coordinate scheduling synchronous work if needed, but am generally unlikely to proactively do so for others (instead preferring asynchronous communication until/unless it's clear that things aren't working well there). 

I generally stay close to Inbox Zero, which means I normally see and read every notification from GitHub, but I don't necessarily subscribe to all repositories (particularly if I find I generally am not interested in the granular details).
If there's ever a specific thing which needs my attention, or where my opinion is welcome or seeked, do ping me.
And just because I see a notification doesn't mean a second ping isn't welcome if I haven't responded.

## Feedback

I definitely welcome candid feedback.
I'm quite a stubborn person at times, so don't be discouraged if I react questioningly, I try to both listen to the feedback and also wrestle with understanding how objectively I agree with it, or figure out what to do about it.
But I always do try to take it to heart.

## Stress

I generally disconnect when dealing with stress (whether that means disengaging from a particular discussion or topic, or disconnecting from programming entirely for a bit).
I thankfully am a lot less stressed dealing with JSON Schema than I may have been in my past lives dealing with previous roles (which involved a lot more meetings, a lot more executive babysitting, and a lot more revenue-driven stress).
Things are no cake walk here but I suspect that the amount of stress I feel at any given moment is likely not high, so unless you see significant signs of the above, you can assume I'm fine.

## Non-work

I like coffee and spend too much money on coffee equipment, beans, etc.
Same likely goes for guitars, I own more guitars (3, plus a ukulele) than someone who plays as little as I do likely deserves to own, but I find it really relaxing and enjoyable to play.
My neighbors may disagree.
I also am a failed mathematician turned software developer, so I at this point have gotten addicted to trying to use my software skills to re-engage with mathematics by playing with theorem provers (and re-learning a bunch of what I need to know to be useful at using one).
And I go to a ton of concerts, play lots of chess (very addictive...), drink lots of amaro, oh and travel a ton.
My favorite part of the world is probably San Sebasti√°n (northern coast of Spain), but Italy has my heart too, and I try to go to each around once a year, amongst finding other new adventures.

## Anything else?

I have trouble convincing myself to buy a piece of art because I'm always worried I'll get bored of it quickly.
Just thought I'd share.
