# Personal Manuals

We have a dispersed team and community, spread across many physical locations, living with different cultures. We are not diverse as we could be, but diverse enough for differences to become apparent.

Creating personal "User Manuals" allows us to help each other understand how we can best work with each other.

In the spirit of trying to work well with each other, those who are part of a team or who are regularly active in the community are **invited** to write a Personal User Manual. (It's by no means a requirement. If you have concerns, try to write something that's as minimal as you feel is OK yet still provides value to your colleagues and collaborators.)

The manuals are found in the `manuals` folder.
The name of the file is the individuals GitHub username, optionally followed by double dash `--` and the users preferred name (either short or long). (GitHub usernames cannot have double hyphens, or begin or end with a hyphen.)

There is a template found in `template.md` which it is recommended you use.

These manuals should be used as an opportunity to understand each other better. You should not expect someone to have read and remembered all the details in your manual.

This page will also list those files in alphabetical order below.
(Please update this manually for now)
