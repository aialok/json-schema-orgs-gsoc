# Case Study Template

## Preface

In looking to publish at least three case studies this year, we need a template of questions to ask organizations.
Here are a list of questions which we should provide for each case study.
The questions themselves should not be in the case study, but we should be able to put the resulting answers together should provide us with a mostly workable case study.

The list is mostly based on the case study format used at https://www.cncf.io/case-studies.

For each question or group of questions, before the dash is providing context, and would not be sent to the case study subject.

We should always seek final approval for the case study subject before publishing.
