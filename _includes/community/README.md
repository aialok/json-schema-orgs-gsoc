# What is this repo?

This repo is a place to discuss and debate various aspects of running the JSON Schema organisation, how we work as a community, and our expectations.

The discussions will primarily take place using [Github Discussions](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/discussions) for this repo.

Initially Github issues will be disabled as we evaluate how we should use them in this repo (through Discussions).

Once we have some links for the community, this readme will link to various locations, resources, and documents that are useful for the community.

# Who can use this repo?

Anyone who wants to learn about, be part of, or help improve the JSON Schema community is welcome here.

Anyone can start a discussion in any category. You can even start a discussion to suggest adding a new category!

# Why do we need this repo to have discussions?

Slack is really great for chatting, working through tricky problems, having one-to-one support sessions.

Slack is not so great for long running ideas, plans, or discussions, a point of reference for decisions, keeping a log of progress.

Using Github Discussions, we can collaborate on important decisions over a longer period of time and have a long standing point of reference

# Why not just use Github Issues?

Github Issues are great for getting work done, but not so great at having threaded debates and discussions.

Picking to use Github Discussions before creating an issue allows us to seek consensus in discussion and keep Issues as the space for tracking work product and its progress.

# Who decided all this? Is it up for debate?

Ben Hutton (@relequestual) created this repo and initial readme on April 2021, based on the expectations of community and organisational needs having grown, supported, and observed the community over the past 5 years.

**None of this is set in stone. Humans are fallible. Everything is up for debate.**

While Ben has become the self-appointed core team lead at some point during those 5 years, we strive to work on a model of general consensus, which works well for specification development, and is something we rely on to move us forward.

Ben acts in several ways as an executive for the organisation, and feels trusted enough to make organisational decisions like this with the expectation of change and with as much transparency as possible.
